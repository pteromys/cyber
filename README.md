Cyber Ad Generator
==================

This meme generator is inspired by two events:

1. The UK's 2020 ad campaign about retraining in "cyber".
2. The Missouri governor's 2021 vow to prosecute the use of "view source".

While the original ad series may have come across badly,
this author believes that this was only due to the choice of
subject&mdash;and that the format is still ripe for exploitation.
